# FruityFizz.github.io
A visually vibrant landing page created as part of my HTML &amp; CSS revision journey. Before diving into JavaScript, I built this project to reinforce my frontend fundamentals — especially responsive design, semantic HTML, and styling techniques.

🔍 Overview
FruityFizz is a mock landing page for a fictional beverage brand. This project helped me revisit key web design concepts by implementing:

Clean semantic HTML structure

Responsive layout using Flexbox & Grid

Consistent typography and spacing

Hover effects and transitions for interactivity

Mobile-friendly design with media queries

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3

Media Queries

Flexbox & Grid Layout

🎯 What I Learned
Structuring HTML with semantic tags

Crafting responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid

Building reusable components for scalable design

Improving visual hierarchy and spacing

Making layout mobile-friendly through media queries

🚀 Future Improvements
Add scroll animations using AOS or vanilla JS

Improve accessibility with ARIA labels

Make it fully interactive using JavaScript

Add contact form and footer section

🧠 Purpose
This project was built during my structured review of Talha Tariq’s Frontend Development course, as a warm-up before learning JavaScript. I believe building real mini-projects is the best way to master concepts — and FruityFizz is the result of that philosophy!
